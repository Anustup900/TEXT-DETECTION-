### Next, we'll fire off training!


Here, we are able to pass a number of arguments:
- **img:** define input image size
- **batch:** determine batch size
- **epochs:** define the number of training epochs. (Note: often, 3000+ are common here!)
- **data:** set the path to our yaml file
- **cfg:** specify our model configuration
- **weights:** specify a custom path to weights. (Note: you can download weights from the Ultralytics Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Drs_Aiu7xx6S-ix95f9kNsA6ueKRpN2J))
- **name:** result names
- **nosave:** only save the final checkpoint
- **cache:** cache images for faster training
